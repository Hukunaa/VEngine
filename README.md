# VEngine
Vulkan Renderer with hardware accelerated raytracing

This is a Discovery project using vulkan and raytracing with a Turing GPU.
The code is not well architectured, but i used this project to learn vulkan and its raytracing capabilities.
Now, I use what i learned in the Omega Engine Project.
